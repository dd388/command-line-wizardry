# Refoldering Drills

For each of these, your goal is to refolder the assets by item, rather than by format. Each is arranged slightly dfferently, but the total number of folder, wav files, and mp3 files should be the same at the end of the process.

Your target arrangement looks like this:

    Audio0001
    -Audio0001.mp3
    -Audio0001.wav

    Audio0002
    -Audio0002.mp3
    -Audio0002.wav
    ...
and so on.

Each folder presents a slight variation on the problem, but your output should be the same. They're roughly ordered on a scale of spiciness, from least to most spicy:
* [jalepeno]
* [serrano]
* [cayenne]
* [habanero]
