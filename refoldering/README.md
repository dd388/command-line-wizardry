# Refoldering Drills

For each of these, your goal is to refolder the assets by item, rather than by format. Each is arranged slightly dfferently, but the total number of folder, wav files, and mp3 files should be the same at the end of the process.

Your target arrangement looks like this:

    Audio0001
    -Audio0001.mp3
    -Audio0001.wav

    Audio0002
    -Audio0002.mp3
    -Audio0002.wav
    ...
and so on.

Each folder presents a slight variation on the problem, but your output should be the same. They're roughly ordered on a scale of spiciness, from least to most spicy:
* [jalepeno](jalepeno "Least spicy task") - Move items out of `PreservationMaster` and `WebCopy`
* [serrano](serrano "Spicier indeed") - Same as above, but now contend with spaces in filenames. `Preservation Master` and `Web Copy`
* [cayenne](cayenne "Even spicier") - Now you actually also have to make the folders, too
* [habanero](habanero "Super spicy task") - I think it's more fun if you figure out on your own what's tricky about this one
