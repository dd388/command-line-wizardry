# Warm-ups!

Here are some tasks to get you started.

## [Standard Refoldering](standard-refolder "Standard Refoldering Warm-Up")

Your goal: Group files together by a specific pattern.

Several books have been digitized and all of the pages from each book have been saved to a single directory, like so:

Book123\_page001.jpg
Book123\_page002.jpg
...
Book128\_page001.jpg
Book128\_page002.jpg
...

Your job is to create a folder for each book (represented by the first part of the filename) and place all of the corresponding files in these folders.

Your target organization is:
Book123
-Book123\_page001.jpg
-Book123\_page002.jpg

Book128
-Book128\_page001.jpg
-Book128\_page002.jpg

_Hint: You can't solve this with one command. In fact, you'll probably find yourself writing a few of them to make this happen._

## [Removing Spaces from Filenames](spaces "Removing Spaces from Filenames Warm-Up")

Your goal: Remove the spaces from the filenames. Depending on how you ambitious you feel, there are two ways you can do this.

* Starter: Rename JPGs to the following format:
Book_0123_001.jpg

* Fancy: Rename JPGs to the following format:
Book0123_001.jpg
