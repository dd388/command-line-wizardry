# Refoldering warm-up

Your goal: Group files together by a specific pattern.

Several books have been digitized and all of the pages from each book have been saved to a single directory, like so:

Book123_page001.jpg
Book123_page002.jpg
...
Book128_page001.jpg
Book128_page002.jpg
...

Your job is to create a folder for each book (represented by the first part of the filename) and place all of the corresponding files in these folders.

Your target organization is:
Book123
-Book123_page001.jpg
-Book123_page002.jpg

Book128
-Book128_page001.jpg
-Book128_page002.jpg

## Hint: You can't solve this with one command. In fact, you'll probably find yourself writing a few of them to make this happen.
